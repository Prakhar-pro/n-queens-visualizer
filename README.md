## N-Queens Visualizer

A visual exploration of local search algorithms which generate solutions to the N-Queens problem.
 Visualizes N-Queens problem using different local search algorithms
* Created an action queue to process moves asynchronously without violating the Flux pattern
* Uses custom-written easing function to simulate real-time speed modulation
* Transmits minimum possible information within action dispatches, to minimize space & time costs
